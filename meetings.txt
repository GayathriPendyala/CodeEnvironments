This is Yuva's Role in meeting
In previous activity I acted as a Team Leader during which I led the team to an active discussion on the ideas and how the ideas can work and how we can improve upon them along with providing feedback to them and providing scope for further discussions. 
This is Pranav's Role in meeting
In the previous activity, I worked as a moderator for the meeting in which I let all the people express their opinions and talk about their ideas and get feedback from others as well and tried to prevent overlap and cross talk to the maximum extent.
